This article presents a classification analysis aiming to identify smokers among Korean NHIS healthcare users based on biological values. Various data mining methods were tested—logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, and Random Forest. 
# Overview
Smoking is a common habit among many people; however, it is one of the leading causes of the development of various diseases, ranging in severity. After age, smoking is the most significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. A smoker's life expectancy is eight years shorter than that of a non-smoker. Moreover, smokers are twice as likely to suffer a heart attack and ten times more likely to develop lung or laryngeal cancer.

For organizations managing healthcare systems, it becomes crucial to know whether an individual is a smoker, as this may lead to increased healthcare costs. A relevant example of this issue was presented in 2014 by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), the single national insurance system in South Korea. The organization initiated legal action against KT&G, the country’s main tobacco producer, seeking 53.3 billion won in compensation for the treatment costs of patients affected by lung and laryngeal cancer.

As a result, NHIS collected various information on its clients, including their smoking status. The analysis conducted in this study aims to develop a classification model capable of predicting whether new individuals—based on known biological values—are smokers. This would allow NHIS to estimate the number of smokers among its clients more accurately.

To build this model, we applied several major classification methods: logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. The most efficient results were achieved using the Random Forest model.
